    <p>Hello everyone! To introduce myself, I am from the Philipppines, which the weather
        is always warm, hot, hotter and hottest (HAHAHA just messing around but it's quite true)
        and I am a graduate from senior high school. ^v^</p>
    <p>I am very fortunate to have Latter-Day Saints parents so I am a born-of-the-covenant child.
        What I really like about the Church is the eternal friends I made and how we help each other
        be better disciples of Jesus Christ. :D</p>
    <p>I currently want to pursue a web design career because I always think that web design
        is very gorgeous and I wanna apply my artistic skills into technology. As long as I can
        remember, I have been drawing since I was a child so I want to put it to good use. ^O^</p>
    <p>My hobbies contain of drawing (tradionally & digitally), watching anime shows & movies,
        video games and listening to music (For ex: K-pop). :3</p>
    <p>So that's me! I hope we can get to know eachother very well and I wish us luck on this
        Web Design journey together. Thank you for reading my web page and have a lovely day! <3</p>
