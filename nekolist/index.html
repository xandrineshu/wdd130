            <h2>But what is anime? And how come it's popular?</h2>
            <p>
                Anime is unique for its art style and storyline that goes beyond its expectations.
                Despite being animated shows, these shows typically cover a wide range of themes, from lighthearted to more mature, making them relatable to all viewers.
                Many people, as well as myself, watch anime as a source of entertainment and as well as comfort.
                So, whether you're young or old, anime has a lot of genres that all can enjoy so don't worry if you think there's some certain age limit or something.
                All are welcome in the anime community!
