      <p>
        Welcome to Nekolist! A website blog where you can browse for ideas on what to watch on your next anime show/movie! Here you can find lots of possible anime suggestions that I personally offer to widen your bucket list of must watch anime!
        Here I will offer lists from best to watch, family friendly, popular, etc. If you're looking to watch anime between 2000 to 2022 then this website is the best for you! My recommendation varies from many genres like romance, action, comedy, slice of life and much more!
        <br>
        If you're new, no problem! I will also suggest some of the best anime for beginners so that you might now feel overwhelm with the number of choices. 
        <br>
        But what is anime? And how come it's popular? Anime is unique for its art style and storyline that goes beyond. Despite being animated shows, these shows typically cover a wide range of themes, from lighthearted to more mature, making them relatable to all viewers. Many people, as well as myself, watch anime as a source of entertainment and as well as comfort.
        So, whether you're young or old, anime has a lot of genres that all can enjoy so don't worry if you think if there's some certain age limit or something. All are welcome in the anime community!

      <h3>Page 2: List of Anime Recommendations</h3>
      <p>
        I would like to warn you that this is a PERSONAL opinion of anime recommendation lists. We all have different taste when it comes to what we like so please don't hate if your favorite anime isn't in here. After all, I simply am sharing what I THINK are great. I have watched anime since childhood so I have a pretty good grasp of knowledge when it comes to anime series and movies.
        Here on this page, I'll be recommending 5 lists, which are:
        <br>
        FOR BEGINNERS, POPULAR ANIME, FAMILY NIGHT, BEST ANIME and ANIME MOVIES.
        <br>
        FOR BEGINNERS is a list of iconic anime that you must certainly watch to start your journey of anime and as well as getting comfortable in the genre.
        <br>
        POPULAR ANIME is a list of audience favored anime that rose up in rankings and won many awards for its story, art, animation, music and etc.
        <br>
        FAMILY NIGHT is a list where you can watch kid friendly anime with family or/and younger ones to make your movie night memorable.
        <br>
        BEST ANIME is a personal list of anime that are a must-watch! I simply love these series and I want to share the beauty and appeal of it.
        <br>
        And ANIME MOVIES is a list of the best films in anime history.

      </ul>
      
      <h3>Page 3: Streaming Sites</h3>
      <p>
        Now that you have series you would to watch, where are you going to watch them? Here are some that are some of the best platforms to watch your favorite anime for free!
        <br>
        AnimePlanet / Crunchyroll / Hulu / Netflix / Bilibili / Funimation / 9anime
        <br>
        These are some of the safest and official website you can try at home whether it's on your phone, your computer or your television! When streaming, you get to watch your favorite series anytime and anywhere!
        <br>
        In my opinion, it is best to stream anime than watching it on television. Of course, you're not limited to following a specific schedule to watch your favorite shows on time. With streaming, you can watch anime online whenever you want. However, with television, it can contain a lot of censorship, which streaming sites remove entirely for a better viewing experience.
        <br>
        Warning! Some streaming sites may not have legal license to stream their shows on their platform so be careful on where you watch your anime! While there are no legal consequences to watching anime for free on such sites, they are still illegal.
        <br>
        When watching anime, some wonder if it should be watched subbed or dubbed and to answer that: It completely depends on personal preference.
        However, we, anime lovers,  prefer the subbed version as it captures the originally intended emotions of the characters, which is often lacking in dubbed versions. Plus, most anime streaming sites may not have dubbed versions of your favorite anime, so the only option is the subbed version.
