                In my opinion, it is best to stream anime than to watch it on television.
                Of course, you're not limited to following a specific schedule
                to watch your favorite shows on time.
                With streaming, you can watch anime online whenever you want.
                However, television can contain a lot of censorship,
                which streaming sites remove entirely for a better viewing experience.

                While there are no legal consequences

                they are still illegal.

            <h2>Sub or Dub anime?</h2>
            <p>
                When watching anime, some wonder if it should be watched subbed, or dubbed, and to answer that:
                It completely depends on personal preference.
                However, we, anime lovers, prefer the subbed version as it captures the originally intended
                emotions of the characters, which is often lacking in dubbed versions.
                Plus, most anime streaming sites may not have dubbed versions of your favorite anime,
                so the only option is the subbed version.
