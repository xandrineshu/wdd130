        <h2>
            I would like to warn you that this is a PERSONAL opinion of anime recommendation lists.
            We all have different tastes when it comes to what we like
            so please don't hate if your favorite anime isn't in here.
            After all, I simply am sharing what I THINK is great.
            I have watched anime since I was younger so I have a pretty good grasp
            of knowledge when it comes to anime series and movies.
            Here on this page, I'll be recommending 5 lists, which are:<br>
            FOR BEGINNERS, POPULAR ANIME, FAMILY NIGHT, BEST ANIME, and ANIME MOVIES.
        </h2>
        <p>
            (There will be only 5 anime per list since there are so much<br>
            anime that can be in the list but then it will be too long.)

                            Hunter x Hunter is set in a world where Hunters exist to perform all manner of dangerous tasks like capturing criminals<br>
                            and bravely searching for lost treasures in uncharted territories. Twelve-year-old Gon Freecss is determined to<br>
                            become the best Hunter possible in hopes of finding his father, who was a Hunter himself and had long ago<br>
                            abandoned his young son. However, Gon soon realizes the path to achieving his goals is far more challenging than he<br>
                            could have ever imagined. Along the way, he befriends the revenge-seeking Kurapika, the aspiring doctor Leorio<br>
                            Paladiknight and a mischievous ex-assassin of Gon's age, Killua Zoldyck. Together, they take the Hunter exam despite<br>
                            its low success rate and high probability of death.

                        family's shrine. Brought to the past, when demons were a common sight in feudal Japan, Kagome finds herself<br>

                        sphere holding extraordinary power. Amid such a predicament, Kagome encounters a half-demon boy named<br>
                        Inuyasha who mistakes her for Kikyou, a shrine maiden he seems to resent. Because of her resemblance to Kikyou,<br>
                        Inuyasha takes a violent dislike to Kagome. However, after realizing the dire circumstances they are both in, he sets<br>
                        aside his hostility and lends her a hand. Unfortunately, during a fight for the Shikon Jewel, the miraculous object ends<br>
                        up shattered into pieces and scattered across the land. Fearing the disastrous consequences of this accident,<br>
                        Kagome and Inuyasha set out on a challenging quest to recover the shards before they fall into the wrong hands.<br>

                        Humans are nearly exterminated by giant creatures called Titans. Titans are typically several stories tall, seem to<br>
                        have no intelligence, devour human beings and, worst of all, seem to do it for the pleasure rather than as a food<br>
                        source. A small percentage of humanity survived by walling themselves in a land protected by extremely high walls,<br>
                        even taller than the biggest of titans. Flash forward to the present, and mankind has not seen a titan in over 100<br>
                        years. One day, 10 year old Eren and his foster sister Mikasa witness something horrific as the city walls are destroyed<br>
                        by a colossal titan that appears out of thin air. As the smaller titans flood the city, the two kids watch in horror as their<br>
                        mother is eaten alive. Eren vows that he will murder every single titan and take revenge for all of mankind.<br>

                            Koro-sensei is confident that his students' ingenuity and indomitable will could return them to the main campus.<br>
                            Through trial and error, Nagisa Shiota, as well as the other students of Class 3-E, must figure out Koro-sensei's<br>
                            weaknesses and fast, for the very fate of the world depends upon it.<br>

                Some anime can be realistic!
            </h4>
            <p>
                Anime isn't a medium that's particularly known for its realism.<br>
                Superpowers, earth-shattering circumstances, and explosive<br>
                battles are pretty much the norm in anime. Even some of the most<br>
                realistic premises can become fantastical and bizarre in this medium.<br>
                However, there are quite a few anime that are realistic like<br>
                "A Silent voice" (2016) by Yoshitoki Oima, "Your Lie in April" (2014)<br>
                by Naoshi Arakawa, and "Wolf Children" (2012) by Mamoru Hosoda.<br>
                Not all anime can be fantasy-like! Some can be real tear-jerkers<br>
                and can pull your heartstrings like it's nothing!<br>
