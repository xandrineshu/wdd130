            I would like to warn you that this is a PERSONAL opinion of anime recommendation lists.
            We all have different tastes when it comes to what we like
            so please don't hate if your favorite anime isn't in here.
            After all, I simply am sharing what I THINK is great.
            I have watched anime since I was younger so I have a pretty good grasp
            of knowledge when it comes to anime series and movies.
            Here on this page, I'll be recommending 5 lists, which are:<br>
            FOR BEGINNERS, POPULAR ANIME, FAMILY NIGHT, BEST ANIME, and ANIME MOVIES.
        </h2>
        <p>
            (There will be only 5 anime per list since there are so much<br>
            anime that can be in the list but then it will be too long.)

                            Hunter x Hunter is set in a world where Hunters exist to perform all manner of dangerous tasks
                            like capturing criminals and bravely searching for lost treasures in uncharted territories.
                            12 year old Gon Freecss is determined to become the best Hunter possible in hopes of finding
                            his father, who was a Hunter himself and had long ago abandoned his young son. However, Gon
                            soon realizes the path to achieving his goals is far more challenging than he could have ever
                            imagined. Along the way, he befriends the revenge-seeking Kurapika, the aspiring doctor Leorio
                            Paladiknight and a mischievous ex-assassin of Gon's age, Killua Zoldyck. Together, they take
                            the Hunter exam despite its low success rate and high probability of death.

                            Kagome Higurashi's 15th birthday takes a sudden turn when she is forcefully pulled by a demon
                            into the old well of her family's shrine. Brought to the past, when demons were a common

                            extraordinary power. In the midst of this, Kagome encounters a half-demon boy named
                            Inuyasha who mistakes her for Kikyou, a shrine maiden he seems to resent. Because of her
                            resemblance to Kikyou, Inuyasha takes a violent dislike to Kagome. However, after realizing

                            shattered into pieces and scattered across the land. Fearing the disastrous consequences
                            of this accident, Kagome and Inuyasha set out on a challenging quest to recover the shards

                            Humans are nearly exterminated by giant creatures called Titans. Titans are typically several
                            stories tall, seem to have no intelligence, devour human beings and, worst of all, seem to do
                            it for the pleasure rather than as a food source. A small percentage of humanity survived by
                            walling themselves in a land protected by extremely high walls, even taller than the bigges
                            of titans. Flash forward to the present, and mankind has not seen a titan in over 100 years.
                            One day, 10 year old Eren and his foster sister Mikasa witness something horrific as the
                            city walls are destroyed by a colossal titan that appears out of thin air. As the smaller
                            titans flood the city, the two kids watch in horror as their mother is eaten alive. Eren
                            vows that he will murder every single titan and take revenge for all of mankind.

                            building that houses the delinquents and dropouts of Class 3-E. Looked down upon by their

                            threat to their planet: their new teacher. Having already destroyed the moon, the

                            20, but he can also resist almost every earthly weapon. Ironically, he also proves to be
                            one of the best teachers Class 3-E has ever had. Through trial and error, Nagisa Shiota,
                            as well as the other students of Class 3-E, must figure out Koro-sensei's weaknesses and 
                            ast, for the very fate of the world depends upon it.

                            the years, with 80 percent of humanity possessing various abilities from manipulation of
                            elements to shapeshifting. This leaves the remainder of the world completely powerless, and
                            Izuku Midoriya is one such individual. Since he was a child, the ambitious middle schooler

                            Takemichi Hanagaki's 2nd year of middle school was the highest point in his life. He had
                            respect, a gang of friends he could count on, and even a girlfriend. But that was twelve
                            years ago. Today, he's a nobody: a washed-up nonentity made fun of by children and always
                            forced to apologize to his younger boss. A sudden news report on the Tokyo Manji Gang's cruel
                            murder of the only girlfriend he ever had alongside her brother only adds insult to injury.
                            Half a second before a train ends his pitiful life for good, Takemichi flashes back to that
                            same day 12 years ago, when he was still dating Hinata Tachibana. After being forced to relive
                            the very same day that began his downward spiral, Takemichi meets Hinata's younger brother.
                            Without thinking, he admits to his seeming death before flashing back to the past. Takemichi
                            urges him to protect his sister before inexplicably returning to the future. Miraculously, he
                            is not dead. Stranger still, the future has changed. It seems as though Takemichi can alter

                            of the Tokyo Manji Gang, Takemichi decides to fly through time to change the course of the future.

                        <p>
                            Inspired after watching a volleyball ace nicknamed "Little Giant" in action, small-statured 
                            Shouyou Hinata revives the volleyball club at his middle school. The newly-formed team even
                            makes it to a tournament; however, their first match turns out to be their last when they are
                            brutally squashed by the "King of the Court," Tobio Kageyama. Hinata vows to surpass Kageyama,
                            and so after graduating from middle school, he joins Karasuno High School's volleyball team,
                            the same volleyball team where the "Little Giant" joined before, only to find that his sworn
                            rival, Kageyama, is now his teammate. Because of his short height, Hinata struggles to find
                            his role on the team, even with his superior jumping power. Surprisingly, Kageyama has his
                            own problems that only Hinata can help with, and learning to work together appears to be the
                            only way for the team to be successful.

                            and writing. One day she notices that all the library books she has have been previously
                            checked out by the same person: 'Seiji Amasawa'. Curious as to who he is, Shizuku meets a
                            boy of her age whom she finds infuriating, but discovers to her shock that he is her
                            'Prince of Books'. As she grows closer to him, she realises that he merely read all those
                            books to bring himself closer to her. The boy, Seiji, aspires to be a violin maker in Italy,
                            and it is his dreams that make Shizuku realise that she has no clear path for her life.
                            Knowing that her strength lies in writing, she tests her talents by writing a story about
                            Baron, a cat statuette belonging to Seiji's grandfather, Shiro Nishi.

                            the petrified. However, Senku's master plan is threatened when his ideologies are challenged
                            by those who awaken. All the while, the reason for mankind's petrification remains unknown.

                            the demon Sullivan. However, Iruma's worries about what will become of him are soon relieved, for
                            Sullivan merely wants a grandchild, pampering him and making him attend the demon school Babyls.
                            At first, Iruma tries to keep a low profile in fear of his peers discovering that he is human.
                            Unfortunately, this ends up being more difficult than he expected. It turns out that Sullivan
                            himself is the chairman of the school, and everyone expects him to become the next Demon King!
                            Iruma immediately finds himself in an outrageous situation when he has to chant a forbidden spell
                            in front of the entire school. With this, Iruma instantly earns a reputation he does not want.
                            Even so, he is bound to be roped into more bizarre circumstances.

                            It's Shouko Komi's first day at the prestigious Itan Private High School, and she has already
                            risen to the status of the school's Madonna. With long black hair and a tall, graceful appearance,
                            she captures the attention of anyone who comes across her. There's just one problem though—despite
                            her popularity, Shouko is terrible at communicating with others. Hitohito Tadano is your average
                            high school boy. With his life motto of “read the situation and make sure to stay away from
                            trouble,” he quickly finds that sitting next to Shouko has made him the enemy of everyone in his
                            class! One day, knocked out by accident, Hitohito later wakes up to the sound of Shouko's “meow.”
                            He lies that he heard nothing, causing Shouko to run away. But before she can escape, Hitohito
                            surmises that Shouko is not able to talk to others easily—in fact, she has never been able to
                            make a single friend. Hitohito resolves to help Shouko with her goal of making one hundred
                            friends so that she can overcome her communication disorder.

                            Sakamichi Onoda is a cheerful otaku looking to join his new school's anime club, eager to
                            finally make some friends. Unfortunately, the club has been disbanded and he takes it upon
                            himself to revive it by finding students who are willing to join. Without much luck, Onoda
                            decides to make a round trip to Akihabara on his old, bulky city bicycle, a weekly 90 km
                            ride he has been completing since fourth grade. This is when he meets fellow first year student,
                            Shunsuke Imaizumi, a determined cyclist who is using the school's steep incline for practice.
                            Surprised by Onoda's ability to climb the hill with his specific type of bicycle, Imaizumi
                            challenges him to a race, with the proposition of joining the anime club should Onoda win.
                            And thus begins the young boy's first foray into the world of high school bicycle racing!

                            campaign. Instead, she dreams of leaving the boring town and tries her luck in Tokyo.

                Some anime can be realistic!
            </h6>
            <p>
                Anime isn't a medium that's particularly known for its realism.
                Superpowers, earth-shattering circumstances, and explosive
                battles are pretty much the norm in anime. Even some of the most
                realistic premises can become fantastical and bizarre in this medium.
                However, there are quite a few anime that are realistic like
                "A Silent voice" (2016) by Yoshitoki Oima, "Your Lie in April" (2014)
                by Naoshi Arakawa, and "Wolf Children" (2012) by Mamoru Hosoda.
                Not all anime can be fantasy-like! Some can be real tear-jerkers
                and can pull your heartstrings like it's nothing!
